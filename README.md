# BatchImageConvertor v 2.3
A tool for automatic images groups processing

#

This tool allows you to convert group of image files (including different formats) into
a single format. If it is necessary, you can specify uniform size, rotation, flip direction
and images mode (color/greyscale/bitmap).

Just place source images to the same folder, select target folder and launch conversion. Progress and
problems that occur will be displayed in the application window.

formats will not be processed.
