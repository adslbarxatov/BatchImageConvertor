This tool allows you to convert group of image files (including different formats) into a single format. If it is necessary, you can specify uniform size or cropping method, rotation, flip direction and images mode (color / greyscale / bitmap).

Also this tool allows you to load or extract palettes, modify and save them. Or even replace the palette inside the indexed bitmap image
