 Known issues:
 • 'Bitmap' conversion mode may work unstably. We work on it.

We are not recommend to use next combinations of conversion:
 • From image with alpha-channel to bitmap image mode;
 • From image with alpha-channel to BMP, JPEG or GIF image format.
These variants may break your images.
Also greyscale conversion may take more time than other types.
