Version 1.2:
 • Publication on GitHub.

Version 1.3:
 • Maximum image dimension (width and height) increased to 4096 px;
 • Some interface artifacts fixed;
 • Image mode (color/greyscale/bitmap) selection added; greyscale conversion uses HDTV coeffs;
 • Image flip and rotation added.
 In this version of application we are not recommend to use next combinations of conversion:
 • From image with alpha-channel to bitmap image mode;
 • From image with alpha-channel to BMP, JPEG or GIF image format.
 These variants may break your images.
 Also greyscale conversion may take more time than other types.
